Prediction-algorithms
=====
This repository hosts two projects:

+ **Heart Disease Prediction:** Predicts the presence of heart disease in patients based on various health metrics.

+ **Wine Quality Prediction:** Predicts the quality of wine based on various chemical properties.

Both projects utilize machine learning algorithms to make predictions.

Data Description
===
Each project uses a specific dataset for analysis:

+ Heart Disease Prediction: The dataset contains information about patients' health metrics and whether they have heart disease.

+ Wine Quality Prediction: The dataset contains information about the chemical properties of different wines and their quality ratings.

Tools and Libraries Used
===
+ Python
+ Pandas
+ NumPy
+ Matplotlib
+ Scikit-learn
